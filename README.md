# luckygame-v2
**luckygame-v2** is a complete rewrite of the original [luckygame](https://github.com/shayanshokry/luckygame), a simple luck-based game built with Python.  
You start with two chances to open mystery boxes. 
Each box contains a random number of points.  
Use these points to buy extra chances and keep playing.
